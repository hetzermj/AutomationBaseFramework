# AutomationBaseFramework

This repo is used to house "Base" projects that provide some generalized QA Automation solutions, readily available to be expanded upon for new project or client needs.

Please see Wiki for more documentation. (Still WIP)

Note: I hope that this repo remains a work in progress as QA Automation is continually growing and changing.
